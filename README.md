WebGraph

WebGraph is a web application with which it is possible to interactively create an undirected weighted graph and calculate the minimum spanning tree from it. A minimal spanning tree is a part of a tree that contains all nodes of the graph. A tree is a connected, circular, undirected graph, called nodes with a degree of 1 leaves, and the remaining nodes called inner nodes. In practice, this calculation is used for cost-effective contiguous networks, such as telephone networks, power grids or computer networks for avoiding packet duplication.
